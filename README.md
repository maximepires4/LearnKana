# LearnKana

LearnKana is a simple web application that helps you learn the Japanese Kana (Hiragana and Katakana) characters. It is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Some components have been inspired from Flowbite and some icons are from Heroicons.

The website is available here: https://maximepires4.github.io/LearnKana/

## Features

- Select which characters to learn
- Enter the pronunciation of each character and see if you are correct
- Reset the list by clicking the prompt at the end of your session or by selecting new characters
